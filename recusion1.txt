What is Recusion?
Functions calling itself.

Solve with smaller instances of that problem.
Like, sum(1 - n) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + .... + n
can also be done as,
sum(1 - n) = sum(1 - n-1) + n
sum(4) = sum(3) + 4


How to write Recursive Code?

Assumptions: Define what the problem does.

Main Logic: Solve your assumption using sub-problems.

Base Condition: Where you have to stop.

sum(5) = sum(4) + 5
sum(4) = sum(3) + 4
sum(3) = sum(2) + 3
sum(2) = sum(1) + 2
sum(1) = sum(0) + 1
sum(0) = sum(-1) + 0  This is wrong

int sum(n){
  if(n=1){ return 1; }
  return sum = sum(n-1) + n;
}


Time complexity and space complexity of recursive codes.

Why Recursion?
- Merge Sort , Quick sort
- Binary Tree, BST, Segment Trees, Tries
- Dynamic Programming
- Backtracking 
- Graphs
